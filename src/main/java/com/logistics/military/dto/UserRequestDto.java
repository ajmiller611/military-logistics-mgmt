/**
 * Data Transfer Object (DTO) for user registration data.

 * <p>This object encapsulates the necessary registration data, including the username,
 * password, and email, required from the client during the user registration process.
 * The DTO is received in the controller layer and processed through the service layer
 * to create a new user in the system.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Validation constraints ensure that each field meets specific criteria before the
 * data is processed, improving data integrity and user experience. Validation groups
 * are defined to sequence constraints to ensure the order the validation occurs.

 *
 * <p>This class also utilizes a custom annotation, <code>@ValidEmail</code>,
 * for advanced email validation.
